## Sidebar Division for Admin & Warehouse

Important Notes:

Each user (Sales, Admin, Warehouse) will have different access rights. For example, Sales users may only be able to view the Sales module, while Admin can access almost all modules. Warehouse users will primarily interact with the Inventory module.

## Sidebar Role Access

Here is the detailed access rights for each role (Sales, Admin, Warehouse) based on the modules we've designed. It follows the principle of "least privilege," meaning each role can only access what is necessary for them to perform their tasks.

### **Access Rights per Role**

---

### **1. Role: Sales**

The main focus is creating orders and tracking their status to inform customers.

* **Module: Sales**

  * **Sales Dashboard:** `[View]`

    * Justification: Only allowed to view the summary of performance and the status of their own orders.
  * **Sales Order (SO):** `[Create, View, Edit Limited]`

    * Justification: Can create new SO, view their own SO list, and edit their own SO *only if* its status is still "Draft" or hasn't been processed by Admin. Cannot view other people's SO.
  * **Delivery Order:** `[View]`

    * Justification: Can only view the delivery orders related to their SO to track the shipments.
  * **Invoice:** `[View]`

    * Justification: Can only view invoices related to their SO to confirm with the customer.
  * **Sales Return:** `[Create, View]`

As the coordination center, Admin has the broadest access to operational and financial modules.

    * Justification: Fully responsible for the master data of products.

## Sidebar Layout

The order of modules in the sidebar is crucial for ease of use (user experience). A well-organized order typically follows the main business workflow, placing the most frequently accessed modules at the top.

Here‚Äôs a recommended order for the sidebar modules that is logical and efficient:

---

### **Recommended Sidebar Module Order**

This order is arranged from the most frequently accessed modules, representing the core business flow, down to the administrative sections.

**1. üè† Dashboard**

* **Reason:** Always the first page seen by users upon login to get a summary of important information.

**2. üõí Sales**

* **Reason:** This is the "entry point" of the entire business flow (starting from customer orders). This module has the highest frequency of use by Sales and Admin teams.

**3. üì¶ Inventory**

* **Reason:** Directly follows the sales process (checking and shipping stock). It‚Äôs closely related to the Sales module and is frequently accessed by both Admin and Warehouse teams.

**4. üöö Purchasing**

* **Reason:** Tightly linked to stock management in the Inventory module (for procuring items when stock is low). It logically follows after Inventory.

**5. üí∞ Finance**

* **Reason:** This module records the outcomes of all previous activities (revenue from sales, expenses for purchases). It‚Äôs placed after the main operational workflow is completed.

**6. üë• HR (Human Resources)**

* **Reason:** A supporting function that isn‚Äôt directly related to goods and money flow. Thus, it is placed towards the bottom.

**7. ‚öôÔ∏è Settings**

* **Reason:** This module is the least frequently accessed (only for user configurations, etc.). As a standard practice in app design, the Settings module is placed at the very bottom.
